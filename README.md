# StrangeJS :squirrel: #

StrangeJS is a collection of crazy, peculiar, and potentially useless/useful modules
I've devised based on strange ideas - you might find these useful you might not...

## Who's this for? ##

- Ever wanted to convert a string to a set of hex colours? (stringToHex)
- Ever wanted to know how far, and how long it would take to walk to the nearest thing? (GeoFind)

## Contributions ##

Please feel free to fork and add your own strange contributions

- Create a folder for your module / code
- Add your code and a top level README
    - README must have a description
    - Example usage
    - Contributor Info - Tell us about yourself!
    - List compliancy - usage info (i.e. ES2016, NodeJS, Browser)

- Don't forget to update the 'Who's this for' section here
